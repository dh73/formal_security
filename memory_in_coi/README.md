# Memory in COI
## Description
This design is to test abstractions when a memory is in the COI of a proof.

## Files
There are two main `.tcl` files, one that runs the design as-is and the other
where abstractions are applied, so we can compare runtimes and efforts in 
both environments.

## FSV and SPV
### FSV Results
* For the file `run_jasper_fsv_no_abstractions.tcl` my machine (Ryzen 1700x with 32GB of RAM)
  cannot get a conclusive result due complexity.
