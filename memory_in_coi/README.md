# Memory in COI
## Description
This design is to test abstractions when a memory is in the COI of a proof.

## Files
There are two main `.tcl` files, one that runs the design as-is and the other
where abstractions are applied, so we can compare runtimes and efforts in 
both environments.

## FSV and SPV
Can I include FSV and SPV scripts?. I think no.
